# MPAA-Classifier-lin127
This is a Bayesian Classifier to determine the MPAA ratings of a movie based on the synopsis.

## Scraper
The scraper parses through IMDB query links to find the movies on the imdb page and then grabs the synopsis, title, and movie description for each movie. It then writes these files to a folder called training.
